# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

We've implemented the following solutions to fix the deployment issues on Vercel:

## 1. URL Construction Fixes

The main error was related to improper URL construction:
```
тип TypeError: Failed to parse URL from ""/api/patients?search=&status=&page=1
```

- Fixed URL construction in `app/patients/page.tsx` to properly handle:
  - Vercel environment URLs
  - Custom API URLs
  - Relative URLs as fallback

## 2. Data File Access

Implemented proper data access strategy for Vercel's serverless environment:

- Created `app/lib/data.ts` with adaptive data loading:
  - Uses filesystem in development
  - Uses fetch with proper base URL in production
  - Improved error handling and logging

## 3. Build Process Improvements

- Added `prebuild` script in `package.json` to copy data files to `public/data`
- Created a debug script to verify file existence during build
- Added `.vercelignore` to ensure data files are included

## 4. Configuration Updates

- Created `next.config.js` with optimized settings for Vercel
- Added proper error handling with a custom error page

## 5. Environment Variables

- Updated code to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL` when available
- Added fallbacks for proper URL construction

## How to Deploy

1. Push these changes to your Git repository
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Vercel should automatically set `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL` environment variable
4. No additional environment variables needed

## Limitations

This implementation has the following limitations:

1. **Read-only Data**: Write operations will not persist between serverless function invocations
2. **Demo Only**: This approach works for demonstration purposes but isn't suitable for production

## Production Recommendations

For a production application:

1. Use a database service like:
   - Vercel KV (Key-Value storage)
   - MongoDB Atlas
   - Supabase
   - PlanetScale (MySQL)
   - Neon (PostgreSQL)

2. Update the code to use the database instead of JSON files

## Debugging

If issues persist:
1. Check Vercel Function Logs for detailed errors
2. Review the debug output in build logs
3. Ensure all data files exist in public/data directory
4. Verify URLs are constructed correctly
